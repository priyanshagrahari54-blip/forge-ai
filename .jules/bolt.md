## 2025-05-18 - Repository Intelligence Indexing Bottlenecks

**Learning:** `SymbolIndex` queries (`by_name`, `by_file`, `by_kind`, `find`), `DependencyGraph` insertion and lookup (`add`, `dependencies_of`, `dependents_of`), and `GitIgnoreMatcher.is_ignored` were all doing linear list scans and un-memoized filesystem syscalls (`target.resolve()`). In indexing routines called repeatedly across repository analysis, this caused quadratic cost scalings (O(N^2) additions and linear search traversals).

**Action:** Maintain internal index hash maps (`_by_name`, `_by_file`, `_by_source`, `_by_target`, `_seen`) on indexing classes as elements are added, and cache path resolution results to avoid repetitive I/O and linear scans during code intelligence traversal.
